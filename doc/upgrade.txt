Upgrading sventon to a newer version

The sventon configuration settings are stored in the file
svn/WEB-INF/classes/default-sventon.properties.
The property key svn.configpath specifies where the repository
index (sventon.idx) is stored.

The easiest way to upgrade sventon is to replace the old svn.war
file and walk through the configuration screens again. As long
as the same repository url and configuration path is used, the
index will be preserved.

Another way is to make a backup copy of the configuration file
svn/WEB-INF/classes/default-sventon.properties, replace the old
svn.war with the new one to trigger a redeploy, and then add the
backed up default-sventon.properties to the svn/WEB-INF/classes
directory again.

It's recommended to backup the configuration file and the index
before upgrading.
