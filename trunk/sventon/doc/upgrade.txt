Upgrading sventon to a newer version

The sventon configuration settings are stored in the file
svn/WEB-INF/classes/sventon.properties.

The easiest way to upgrade sventon is to replace the old svn.war
file and walk through the configuration screen again.

Another way is to make a backup copy of the configuration file
svn/WEB-INF/classes/sventon.properties, replace the old
svn.war with the new one to trigger a redeploy, and then add the
backed up sventon.properties to the svn/WEB-INF/classes directory again.

The index file format has changed between 1.0 RC1 and 1.0 RC2.
A complete index rebuild is necessary.
