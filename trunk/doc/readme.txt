sventon is a Subversion web client for Java Servlet containers. It makes use 
of mainly two different sofware packages, TMate JavaSVN and Spring framework, 
all necessary libraries are included in the project.

Java 1.5 is required for build and deploy, thus Tomcat 5.5 may be a good 
container companion. Jakarta Ant build files are supplied for building.

The JHighlight library from https://jhighlight.dev.java.net is used for
syntax highlighting, slightly modified.
Currently the library supports colorization of the following file formats:
* HTML/XHTML
* Java
* XML
* LZX
* RIFE (https://rife.dev.java.net)

Support for more formats are planned before the first official release of sventon.

Build instructions:
1: Run ant/build.xml for info on building.
